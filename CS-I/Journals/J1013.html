    1. Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction =/?
    <br>
  The output is true if either of the inputs are true but both are not true. 
<br>
2. Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2n?
<br>
Assuming that we have "n" inputs we may label each input as i1, i2, i3, and I'n. The value of the inputs on any given row, may be referred to as an input tuple. Likewise, assuming that we have "m" outputs we may label each output as O1, O2, O3, and O'n.
