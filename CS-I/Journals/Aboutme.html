   <h2> Hello my name is Abdulla Hassen. I am a CS-I student
    under Mrs.jang. This is my first year getting into coding I look forward to learning new things. I enjoy going to the gym to lift, playing video games and hanging out with friends.
    <br>
    My digital portfolio is important to me because it creates organization with all my files and shows my progress throughout the year.
