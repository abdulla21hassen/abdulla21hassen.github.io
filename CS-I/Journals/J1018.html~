    Section 1
    <br>
    Question 1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?
    <br>
    The AND Truth Table.
<br>
Question 2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?
<br>
    The OR Truth Table.
<br>
<br>
Section 2
<br>
Question 1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?
<br>
    The first half is a AND gate and the last half is an OR gate.
<br>
    Question 2: Why is this true?
    The first half is a AND gate because both a and b has to be true while the last half is an OR gate due to only needing one true to be true.
<br>
<br>
Section 3
<br>
Question 1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?
<br>
    Because it can add two bits while the full can add 3 bits.
<br>
Question 2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?
<br>
    No, because it has to go through all the adders.
<br>
Question 3:Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that {\displaystyle C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
<br>

I learned that adders can add 16 bits or info and they are different kinds of adders.
<br>
<br>
What challenges did I encounter?
<br>
I rncoumtered challenges when learning vocabulary
<br>
<br>
How could this experience be improved?
<br>
This experience could be improved by more examples
<br>
<br>
Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
<br>
I reliazed that binary is everywhere
